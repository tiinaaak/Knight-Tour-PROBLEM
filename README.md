The Knight's Tour problem is a classic chess problem that seeks to find a sequence of moves 
for a knight on an n * n chessboard to visit every square exactly once. We present an 
implementation of the Knight's Tour problem using  the Naive method , the Warnsdoff's Algorithm and the 
Backtracking method.
